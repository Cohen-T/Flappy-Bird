                                <p>Cyberbullies often do what they do for a few reasons. They could be too scared to talk to you in person, or they have issues that they take out on people online. Cyberbullying can even be accidental. Somebody can share an offensive joke with someone else, not knowing that they would be offended by it. Even though it may be accidental, it is still a form of cyberbullying.</p>

                                    <p>It's astonishing how cruel people can be online. I became a victim of cyberbullying when a colleague started a smear campaign against me, spreading lies and manipulating images to damage my reputation. The impact on my mental health was devastating; I couldn't escape the online attacks even in the sanctuary of my own home. Sharing my story empowers me to raise awareness about the real-world consequences of digital harassment and advocate for stricter measures against online bullying.</p>

                                    <p>The internet used to be my escape, a place where I could connect with others who shared my interests. That changed when I encountered relentless cyberbullying in a gaming community. Strangers targeted me with hateful messages and even doxxed my personal information. It shattered my sense of safety online, and I had to abandon my favorite hobby to protect myself. Now, I speak out against cyberbullying, hoping to create a safer online environment for others who may face the same kind of harassment.</p>

                                    <p>Cyberbullying turned my life upside down. I used to love social media, but when a group of classmates started targeting me with hurtful comments and spreading false rumors online, it became a nightmare. I felt isolated and helpless as the harassment escalated. Opening up about my experience helped me find support, but the scars from those digital attacks linger, a constant reminder of the cruelty that can unfold behind a screen.</p>
